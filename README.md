The inspiration for my game were multiple drawing games and to a certain extent, Microsoft paint. the concept of my code is to have a coloring canvas where you can adjust the size and overall just use it to paint on a computer.


the first part of the code simply makes the canvas and right under is are the base values such as the color and size of the paintbrush which are the color black and 20 px. right after that are the mouse controls which are indicated as any button on the mouse since some mice have side buttons as well as the paintbrush shape which is a circle. lastly is the colors where the else if command is used to change things from true to false to change colors where the number keys are each assigned to a different number key shown below. Lastly, is the code for change the paintbrush size in increments of 5 using the up and down arrow keys to change it.
